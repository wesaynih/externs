## Closure Compiler externs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wesaynih/externs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wesaynih/externs)

Extern files help Closure Compiler minifying. More detailed definitions can lead to smaller output files. We have added many improvements to the extern files that are shipped with Closure Compiler and we think they are so useful that creating a separate project might be useful.

## Roadmap

We'd also love to be able to use these files for autocomplete in code editors. Maybe we'll create a plugin for Tern.
